        <description>&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade of immersing myself in the world of CG and gaming, I have finally made the decision to start my own blog. This space will serve as a platform for my personal growth, allowing me to make incremental changes and improvements every single day. Inspired by the timeless principle that &amp;ldquo;the best way to learn something is to teach it,&amp;rdquo; I aim to share my insights, observations, and experiences with the wider community. Join me on this exciting journey of exploration as I delve into industry trends, machine learning, art, games, characters, rigging, mathematics, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
